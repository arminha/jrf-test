# Profiling using the Java Flight Recorder

## What is the Java (JDK) Flight Recorder?

* An **event based** tracing framework, build **into** the Java Runtime
* Extremely **low overhead (<%1)**, designed for use in production
* With APIs for
  * Producing application level events
  * Analysing events and event streams
* Events can be dumped into a file or streamed over JMX

### GUIs for analysis

* [JDK Mission Control](https://github.com/openjdk/jmc)
* [VisualVM](https://visualvm.github.io/)
* [Java JFR Profiler](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20937-java-jfr-profiler) for IntelliJ

### Where can I use it?

JFR requires OpenJDK 11+ or OpenJDK 8u262 ([release notes](https://mail.openjdk.org/pipermail/jdk8u-dev/2020-July/012143.html))

JMX streaming requires OpenJDK 17+.

### How to use it?

There are lots of configuration knobs. Azul has a good [documentation](https://docs.azul.com/prime/Java-Flight-Recorder).

For our test we start the JFR with JVM parameters. We use the two default profiles that come with the JVM.

1. The [Profiling Profile](./profile.jfc) has around 2% performance overhead  
   `-XX:StartFlightRecording=dumponexit=true,settings=profile,filename=profile.jfr`
2. The [Default Profile](./default.jfc) has around 1% performance overhead and is meant for continuous use in production   
   `-XX:StartFlightRecording=dumponexit=true,settings=default,filename=default.jfr`
